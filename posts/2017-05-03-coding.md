Trying to crack on with coding this week. Went back to my initial notes and then chucked the key points and quotes into a spreadsheet, trying to attach common codes to things. I then hid the specific quotes and names and tried to form categories from here.

What i've found is that codes fit within the JISC/NUS categories that I used, but I'm starting to see themes emerging from emotive language and specifically students on one course talking about being 'encouraged' rather than 'expected' to use technology.

Here's a screenshot of the preliminary coding:
